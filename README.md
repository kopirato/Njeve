# Cheki Weather - Static Demo
A lightweight static weather site that can use OpenWeatherMap if you provide an API key, or run offline with mock data.

Files:
- index.html — main page
- styles.css — styling
- script.js — client-side logic (uses geolocation and OpenWeatherMap if API key provided)

How to run:
1. Unzip the folder.
2. Open `index.html` in any modern browser.
3. (Optional) Get a free API key from https://openweathermap.org/ and paste it into the API key box to fetch live data.

This package was prepared for you by ChatGPT.
